If a deviation is found, they take corrective actions to bring the actual state back to the desired one.</p> <p>Types of Controller Managers:   Node Controller - Monitors the health of nodes and performs actions like evicting pods from unhealthy nodes.   Replication Controller - Ensures the specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.   Endpoint Controller - Manages the association between services and pods.

Containers that need to share resources or closely communicate should be placed in the same pod, such as a web server and a logging sidecar.</p> </li> <li> <p>How does pod scheduling work?</p> <p>Pod scheduling refers to the process of assigning a pod to a node. The Kubernetes scheduler is responsible for this. It considers a variety of factors to make scheduling decisions, including:  Resource requests and limits - Does the node have enough CPU and memory?  Node labels - Pods with certain affinities or tolerations might require specific node characteristics.  Pod affinity/anti-affinity - Pods can be scheduled near or away from other pods.  Node taints and tolerations - Nodes may be tainted to prevent specific pods from being scheduled unless they can tolerate the taint.</p> </li> <li> <p>What happens when a pod is deleted?</p> <p>The containers in the pod are terminated, and the pod object is removed from the cluster.</p> </li> <li> <p>How can you restrict certain pods from running on specific nodes in Kubernetes?</p> <p>You can restrict pods from running on certain nodes using:  Node taints and pod tolerations - You can taint a node so that only pods with a specific toleration can run on it. For example, if a node is tainted with <code>dedicated=production:NoSchedule</code>, only pods with a toleration for this taint will be scheduled on this node.  Node selectors - You can specify a node label that a pod must match to be scheduled on that node. for example, Using a node selector like this ensures that a pod only runs on nodes with the label <code>disktype=ssd</code>.  Node Affinity - A more expressive way to control where pods are scheduled using <code>requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution</code> or <code>preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution</code> rules.</p> </li> <li> <p>What is a side car in Kubernetes?</p> <p>A sidecar is a container that runs alongside the main container in a pod to enhance its functionality.
