# wanna be polymath

hey, this is my personal website / blog / portfolio(?).
huge thanks to mkdocs and all its contributors.

## getting started

```bash
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1    # for windows
pip install poetry
poetry init
```

## Project layout

```
mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
docs/
    index.md  # The documentation homepage.
    ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
```

## to do

1. script that makes all the titles with capital letters.
2. in the academy there are questions in each topic. I would like each question to have parameters like difficulty level, tags and so on. then a user can run a script to generate an exam for himself with given tags and difficulties.
3.
