# Accessibility

## language

I want it to be accessible and readable for everyone.
the language barrier might make it difficult but I will add an option to pick a language and translate everything.

for now I will write everything in english as its a global language and its written from left to right so it doesn't mess my formatting.

## disabilities

deaf and Hearing impaired people can read everything so thats fine. videos that will be published will have subtitles.

blind and vision impaired people will have more of a problem using the platform. I'm not sure if they have their own tools that read loudly all the text it finds, but I will make sure there are integrated tools for it in the website, a video with a voice introduction and guide on how to use it.

color blind people might have difficulty with the given light and dark mode color choices, so I need to add one for them without problematic colors.

## exposure

maybe someday I will publish it as a standalone website, so it could be more searchable in google.

## Licensing

which license should I use?
