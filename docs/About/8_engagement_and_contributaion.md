# engagement and contribution 

people should be encouraged to ask questions, respond and give feedback.
the ways to do so are:

1.  email
2.  github issues
3.  post on platforms such as social media

the way I respond is also important.  
I should create a sense of community around the discussion and feedback as well as the knowledge sharing itself.
