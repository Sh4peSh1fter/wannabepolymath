# Vision

I want something that will contain all my work and thoughts in my journey to become a polymath.  
it should inspire and encourage everyone to do it too.

It would be nice if people can interact with the content and share their thoughts, and help me to improve it.

## Key Points

- free to use
- open source - so people can clone and adjust it to their needs.
- no registration required for basic usage
- accessible to everyone
