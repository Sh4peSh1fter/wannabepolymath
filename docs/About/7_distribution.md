# distribution

publication, exposure

maybe someday I will publish it as a standalone website, so it could be more searchable in google.  
until then we need to think about the distribution - the platforms or channels where I want to publish or share the content, such as a website, blog, social media, podcast hosting platforms, and more.

1.  medium
2.  github
3.  linkedin
4.  twitter
5.  reddit

we also need to think about promotion, so we can give people teasers or short relevant versions of the content in places where it can’t or shouldn’t be published on as is.
