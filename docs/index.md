# Welcome to the Wanna be Polymath project

This project is a mix of a personal website, a blog and a portfolio.

I want to organize and share cool things I learn, so I'm gathering everything here - hopefully it would help someone.

I divided the website into different sections, each with its own unique style and purpose.

## Structure

0. Home - landing page, explaining this project, how to use it and how to take part.
1. Round Table - discuss and strategize problems and solutions to different things.
2. Incubator - incubate ideas and projects.
3. Academy - share tutorials, how-tos, guides and troubleshooting journals on different subjects.
4. Observatory - store different collections of keywords that we will or have learned.
5. Bazaar - share small and random day to day things we have learned.
6. Forge - try improving ourselves generally and our day to day life.
7. About - a small about me page.

## Project layout
