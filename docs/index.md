# Welcome to the Wanna be Polymath project

hey :)  

I'm learning new stuff everyday and I want to share some of them in my own unique way.  

the goal is simple. I want to be a polymath, I want to document some stuff that I write, and I want you to see my journey and get encouraged.  
hopefully the way I do it can help some of you improve your knowledge, thinking, and life itself.

how to use it?  
just follow along the structure and take a look in the stuff that interests you.

how to contribute?  
any feedback will be very helpful!

## Getting Started

I divided the website into different sections, each with its own unique style and purpose.

### Structure

1. home - landing page, explaining this project and how to use it.
2. about - about this project, how it was built, and general things about it. 
3. corners - random stuff that I'm writing that can't really fit in the "topics" section.
4. topics - things that interests me and I try to learn, divided into topics and sub-topics.
