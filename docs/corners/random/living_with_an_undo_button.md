# living with an undo button

what if we lived with an undo button?  
what if we could undo whenever we wanted?  
what if we couldn't control it?  
what if there was a price to undo? for example a year off our life?  
how does it effect how we think or feel about stuff?  




## where can we see it?
re zero
