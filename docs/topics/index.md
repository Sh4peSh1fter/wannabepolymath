## What is it

group of topics and sub-topics that I study and summarize.  
this shouldn't be a wikipedia 2, nor an AI generated summarized data. the purpose is to write down specific data for myself.

## Why is it done this way

when I study something, its helpful to write some things down because then it stored better in my head.

writing summaries can save time when revisiting some topics, as well as getting me better at explaining topics to other people - when I write down summaries in my own words it feels like I need to understand better the topic and explain it to someone new in a simple understandable way.

## Layout / Architecture

it really depends on the topics. when I sit and study something, I just create files of the sub-topics and write to them, and then wrap them in a folder of larger theme or topic. so the creation goes from bottom to top and you never know what is the final large topic that consists of all of this.

### Templates

we need to define standards for writing down a topic, for consistency and readability. so I wrote a template for writing a generic topic. 

when discussing a topic, there are helpful parts or sections that we write down and every topic should have them, like a "sources" section, or a "questions" section. we can build a pattern and template it for all the topics to use.






it should be like puzzle blocks. each topic should have its format and places at the bottom, and we can wrap it in wrappers to group topics and place them in the field.
