      To display the top 5 processes by memory usage:

      ```bash
      ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 6
      ```

2.  What is load average?

7.  What is the difference between a hard link and a soft (symbolic) link?

    A hard link is a direct reference to the fileâ€™s inode. Changes made to a file are reflected in all hard links because they share the same inode.  
     A soft link (symbolic link) points to the file path rather than the inode. If the original file is deleted, the soft link becomes broken (invalid).

    To create a hard link:

    ```bash
    ln file1 <hardlink_name>
    ```

    To create a soft link:

    ```bash
    ln -s /path/to/file <symlink_name>
    ```

    To check the disk space usage of the filesystem:

   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

   To display the disk usage of a directory:

   ```bash
   du -h <directory_path>

## Networking

1.  How to see all the ports and their status?

    The netstat, ss, and lsof commands can be used to list open ports and their associated processes.  
     Using netstat:

    ```bash
    netstat -tuln
    ```

    Using ss (a more modern alternative to netstat):

    ```bash
    ss -tuln
    ```

    Using lsof to list open files and network connections:

    ```bash
    sudo lsof -i -P -n
    ```

    grep "search_string" <file_name>
    ```

    To search for a string recursively in a directory:

    ```bash
