- what are the best practices

## to do

1. format all the terms with "\`". for example: \`<term>\`

or \*\*term\*\* because parts of code in the paragraph should differ from it. I think I will do this so its easier to find and change it later, because the "\*" is unique, while the "\`" is used for code blocks.

2. all titles and sub titles should be capitalized (proper case format).

3. all paragraphs should be formatted withe sentence case.

4. write a script for formatting the "questions" file. wrap each answer in its own div and style, style each question, manage spacing. capitalize all sentences. get a terms list and **bold** the terms found in the file.
