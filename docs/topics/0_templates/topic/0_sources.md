# Sources

sources can come in different types and forms. we will list all of them here to better find and map those sources when needed.  
we need to identify those **sources** and the **platforms** they post on.

the source can be an individual, a group or an organization / company, or a community. 

the platforms those sources post on are media platforms which can take a verity of forms:

- news site
- blog
- social media
- podcast
- videos
- magazine / journal
- personal website
- other website or platform

as for examples of the platforms in each type, it really depends on the topic.  
except for social media, which consists of platforms that cover wide range of topics:

- facebook
- instagram
- threads
- twitter
- linkedin

and videos:

- youtube
- twitch

so a best practice that I suggest to follow is to find more info about the source from each of the social medias in this list.
